= Jindo(珍島)

**J**VM **I**ntegrated, **N**o-**D**eps **O**peration

== Why Jindo?

We need to run git-hooks in our project with just JVM.
Don't rely on pre-commit or husky anymore.
Here's a simple, fast, and lightweight 🐕 Jindo.

== Requirements

- Just require JVM(8+)
- Not require any other dependencies
- Run separately from the package manager(like Gradle, Maven, SBT, etc...)
